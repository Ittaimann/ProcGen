//Goals:
//generate random clusters of items
//priority/rareness idea
//spawn intermittently, with time to spawn



//Want to spawn a few "seeds" at first *
//Then, get locations of those seeds *
//and spawn a few items near those seeds;
//Check that the items spawned do not overlap with another
//Then, use this function to get array of item near seed
//If there are too many near seed, choose another random object in array to be seed
//spawn objects around that random object then
//repeat this until spawn count is depleted
// maybe use recursion? if i can figure out how to use it
